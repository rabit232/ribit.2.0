## Development Standards

### Code Style

Ribit 2.0 follows Python best practices with emphasis on readability and maintainability:

```python
# Use clear, descriptive variable names
emotional_response_generator = EmotionalResponseGenerator()
conversation_context = manager.get_recent_context(limit=10)

# Include comprehensive docstrings
def analyze_emotional_context(message: str, history: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Analyze the emotional context of a message based on conversation history.
    
    Args:
        message: The current message to analyze
        history: Recent conversation history for context
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping emotion names to confidence scores
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If message is empty or history is malformed
    """
    pass

# Use type hints for better code clarity
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union

def process_search_results(
    results: List[Dict[str, str]], 
    emotion_context: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]:
    """Process search results with emotional intelligence."""
    pass
```

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling with graceful degradation:

```python
try:
    search_results = await jina_engine.search_web(query)
except ConnectionError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Search service unavailable: {e}")
    return self._generate_fallback_response(query)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error in search: {e}")
    return "I encountered an unexpected issue while searching. Please try again."
```

### Logging

Use structured logging for better debugging and monitoring:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process_user_request(request: str) -> str:
    logger.info(f"Processing user request: {request[:50]}...")
    
    try:
        response = self._generate_response(request)
        logger.debug(f"Generated response length: {len(response)}")
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to process request: {e}", exc_info=True)
        raise
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

Organize tests logically with clear naming conventions:

```python
import pytest
from ribit_2_0.mock_llm_wrapper import MockRibit20LLM

class TestMockRibit20LLM:
    """Test suite for the MockRibit20LLM emulator."""
    
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures before each test method."""
        self.llm = MockRibit20LLM("test_knowledge.txt")
    
    def teardown_method(self):
        """Clean up after each test method."""
        self.llm.close()
    
    def test_basic_decision_making(self):
        """Test basic decision making functionality."""
        response = self.llm.get_decision("Hello, introduce yourself")
        assert "Ribit" in response
        assert len(response) > 50
    
    def test_emotional_responses(self):
        """Test emotional intelligence in responses."""
        response = self.llm.get_decision("I'm feeling sad today")
        emotional_words = ["empathy", "understanding", "support", "care"]
        assert any(word in response.lower() for word in emotional_words)
```

### Integration Tests

Create integration tests for complex workflows:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_matrix_bot_integration():
    """Test Matrix bot integration with conversation management."""
    # Setup test environment
    bot = RibitMatrixBot("test_server", "test_user", "test_pass")
    
    # Test message processing
    test_message = "Search for Python tutorials"
    response = await bot.process_message(test_message, "test_room", "test_user")
    
    # Verify response quality
    assert len(response) > 100
    assert "search" in response.lower()
    assert any(emotion in response.upper() for emotion in ["CURIOSITY", "EXCITEMENT"])
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ribit_2_0

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_llm_wrapper.py
pytest tests/test_integration.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

## Documentation Standards

### API Documentation

Document all public APIs with comprehensive docstrings:

```python
class AdvancedConversationManager:
    """
    Advanced conversation management with emotional intelligence and analytics.
    
    This class provides sophisticated conversation tracking, user interaction
    pattern analysis, and emotional context management for AI agents.
    
    Attributes:

        cache_size: Maximum number of conversations to keep in memory
        
    Example:
        >>> manager = AdvancedConversationManager()
        >>> message = ConversationMessage(
        ...     room_id="!example:matrix.org",
        ...     user_id="@user:matrix.org",
        ...     content="Hello Ribit!",
        ...     emotion_state="CURIOSITY"
        ... )
        >>> message_id = manager.add_message(message)
    """
    
    def get_conversation_context(
        self, 
        room_id: str, 
        limit: int = 50,
        min_relevance: float = 0.0
    ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Retrieve conversation context with relevance filtering.
        
        Args:
            room_id: Unique identifier for the conversation room
            limit: Maximum number of messages to retrieve
            min_relevance: Minimum relevance score for message inclusion
            
        Returns:
            List of conversation messages with metadata, sorted by relevance
            and recency. Each message includes content, emotion state, and
            contextual information.
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If room_id is empty or limit is negative
            DatabaseError: If database connection fails
            
        Example:
            >>> context = manager.get_conversation_context(
            ...     room_id="!example:matrix.org",
            ...     limit=20,
            ...     min_relevance=0.3
            ... )
            >>> print(f"Retrieved {len(context)} relevant messages")
        """
