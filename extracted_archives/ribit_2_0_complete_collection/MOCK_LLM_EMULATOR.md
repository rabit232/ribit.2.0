# Later interaction - context is preserved
response = llm.get_decision("How can you help with this?")
# Response will reference the robotics project context
```

### 2. Adaptive Response Generation

Responses adapt based on conversation history and user patterns:

```python
# Technical user - gets detailed responses
llm.get_decision("Explain the control algorithm")

# Casual user - gets accessible explanations
llm.get_decision("How does this work?")
```

### 3. Error Recovery and Uncertainty Handling

The emulator gracefully handles uncertain situations:

```python
# Uncertain query
response = llm.get_decision("Perform quantum teleportation")
# Response: Honest acknowledgment of limitations with helpful alternatives
```

### 4. Creative Task Execution

The emulator can handle creative and artistic tasks:

```python
# Creative drawing task
response = llm.get_decision("Draw a robot playing piano")
# Response: Detailed multi-step creative process
```
