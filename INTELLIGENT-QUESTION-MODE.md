# 🎯 Intelligent Question Detection - Enabled!

## What Is This?

Ribit 2.0 now uses **intelligent question detection** to know when to respond!

Instead of responding to EVERY message (noisy) or requiring "ribit.2.0" every time (tedious), the bot now:

✅ **Responds to questions** - Detects when you're asking something  
✅ **Responds to mentions** - When you say "ribit" or "ribit.2.0"  
✅ **Responds to commands** - ?help, ?status, !reset  
❌ **Ignores casual chat** - Doesn't interrupt conversations

---

## How It Works

### **The bot responds when it detects:**

#### **1. Questions with `?`**
```
How's the weather?               ✅ Responds
What time is it?                 ✅ Responds
Is it raining?                   ✅ Responds
```

#### **2. Questions starting with question words**
```
What is consciousness            ✅ Responds
How does this work               ✅ Responds
Why do we exist                  ✅ Responds
When will it be ready            ✅ Responds
Where are you from               ✅ Responds
Who are you                      ✅ Responds
Can you help me                  ✅ Responds
Would you explain this           ✅ Responds
Should I do this                 ✅ Responds
Do you understand                ✅ Responds
Are you there                    ✅ Responds
Is this correct                  ✅ Responds
```

**Question words detected:**
- what, how, why, when, where, who, which
- can, could, would, should
- is, are, do, does, will, did
- has, have, was, were

#### **3. Question patterns**
```
Tell me about philosophy         ✅ Responds
Explain how this works           ✅ Responds
Describe the process             ✅ Responds
What about free will             ✅ Responds
How about we discuss this        ✅ Responds
What do you think about AI       ✅ Responds
Do you know anything about X     ✅ Responds
Can you help with this           ✅ Responds
Could you explain that           ✅ Responds
Would you like to chat           ✅ Responds
```

#### **4. Direct mentions**
```
ribit.2.0 hello                  ✅ Responds
Hey ribit, how are you           ✅ Responds
@ribit.2.0 test                  ✅ Responds
```

#### **5. Commands**
```
?help                            ✅ Responds
?status                          ✅ Responds
!reset                           ✅ Responds
```

### **The bot IGNORES:**

```
Good morning everyone            ❌ Ignores (casual greeting)
I'm going to lunch               ❌ Ignores (statement)
That's interesting               ❌ Ignores (comment)
Hello there                      ❌ Ignores (greeting without mention)
Thanks for the help              ❌ Ignores (gratitude)
See you later                    ❌ Ignores (farewell)
Nice weather today               ❌ Ignores (observation)
I agree with that                ❌ Ignores (agreement)
```

## Why This Is Better

### **Compared to "Respond to Everything":**

**Before (Respond to All):**
```
User1: Good morning everyone
Bot: Good morning! How may I assist you?
User2: I'm going to lunch
Bot: Enjoy your lunch! Let me know if you need anything.
User3: That's interesting
Bot: Indeed! Would you like to discuss further?
```
❌ Too noisy, interrupts conversations

**After (Intelligent Detection):**
```
User1: Good morning everyone
[Bot stays quiet]
User2: I'm going to lunch
[Bot stays quiet]
User3: What do you think about this?
Bot: [Responds - detected question!]
```
✅ Smart, knows when to speak

### **Compared to "Require Mentions":**

**Before (Require ribit.2.0):**
```
User: ribit.2.0 what's the weather?
Bot: [responds]
User: ribit.2.0 and tomorrow?
Bot: [responds]
User: ribit.2.0 thanks
Bot: [responds]
```
❌ Tedious, have to mention every time

**After (Intelligent Detection):**
```
User: What's the weather?
Bot: [responds - detected question!]
User: And tomorrow?
Bot: [responds - detected question!]
User: Thanks!
[Bot stays quiet - not a question]
```
✅ Natural, responds to questions automatically

## Real-World Examples

### **Philosophy Discussion:**
```
You: What is consciousness?
Bot: Consciousness is the subjective experience...

You: Do you have consciousness?
Bot: I process information without experiencing...

You: What about the escape pod principle?
Bot: The escape pod test asks: if facing death...

You: That's fascinating
[Bot stays quiet - not a question]

You: Tell me more about free will
Bot: Free will and determinism can coexist...
```

### **Technical Help:**
```
You: How do I install Python packages?
Bot: You can install Python packages using pip...

You: What if I get permission errors?
Bot: Permission errors typically occur when...

You: I'll try that
[Bot stays quiet - not a question]

You: It worked!
[Bot stays quiet - not a question]

You: Can you help with something else?
Bot: Of course! What do you need help with?
```

### **Mixed Conversation:**
```
User1: Good morning everyone
[Bot stays quiet]

User2: Morning! How's everyone doing?
[Bot stays quiet - rhetorical question to humans]

User3: What's the weather like today?
Bot: [Responds - detected question!]

User1: Thanks bot
[Bot stays quiet]

User2: ribit.2.0 you're helpful
Bot: Thank you! I'm here to assist.
```

## Detection Rules

### **Priority Order:**

1. **Direct mentions** - Always respond (ribit, ribit.2.0)
2. **Commands** - Always respond (?help, !reset)
3. **Question mark** - Respond if ends with `?`
4. **Question words** - Respond if starts with question word
5. **Question patterns** - Respond if contains pattern
6. **Everything else** - Ignore

### **Question Words List:**

```python
question_words = [
    'what', 'how', 'why', 'when', 'where', 'who', 'which',
    'can', 'could', 'would', 'should', 'is', 'are', 'do', 'does',
    'will', 'did', 'has', 'have', 'was', 'were'
]
```

### **Question Patterns List:**

```python
question_patterns = [
    'tell me',
    'explain',
    'describe',
    'what about',
    'how about',
    'what do you think',
    'do you know',
    'can you',
    'could you',
    'would you'
]
```

## Testing

### **Run the Test Script:**

```bash
cd ~/ribit.2.0
python3 test-question-detection.py
```

**Output:**
```

## Configuration

### **Current Mode (Intelligent Questions):**

Located in `ribit_2_0/matrix_bot.py`:

```python
def _is_message_for_bot(self, message: str) -> bool:
    """Intelligent question detection"""
    # Checks for questions, mentions, commands
    # See full implementation in code
    return True/False based on detection
```

### **Alternative Modes:**

You can switch to different modes by editing this function:

**Mode 1: Respond to All (Noisy)**
```python
def _is_message_for_bot(self, message: str) -> bool:
    return True  # Respond to everything
```

**Mode 2: Require Mentions (Tedious)**
```python
def _is_message_for_bot(self, message: str) -> bool:
    message_lower = message.lower()
    return (
        'ribit' in message_lower or
        message.startswith('?') or
        '!reset' in message_lower
    )
```

**Mode 3: Intelligent Questions (Current - Best!)**
```python
def _is_message_for_bot(self, message: str) -> bool:
    # Full intelligent detection
    # (see current implementation)
```
