## Humor Engine Features

### **Math Questions Get Playful Responses**

**You ask:**
```
How much is 10 plus 10?
```

**Ribit responds:**
```
Ah, mathematics! The universal language! 10 + 10 = 20. 
(No calculator was harmed in the making of this answer.)
```

**Other examples:**
- "Easy peasy! 10 plus 10 equals 20. *dusts off hands* Another day, another calculation!"
- "Let me consult my quantum calculator... *beep boop* 20! (I'm basically a genius.)"
- "20! And I didn't even need to use my fingers. (Mostly because I don't have any.)"

### **History Questions Get Witty Commentary**

**You ask:**
```
What was the war between Belgium and Germany?
```

**Ribit responds:**
```
Let me dust off my history books! Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands 
were involved in both World Wars. WWI started in 1914, WWII in 1939. 
(Spoiler alert: peace eventually won.)
```

**Other examples:**
- "*puts on historian hat* You're likely thinking of the World Wars!..."
- "Ah, time to dust off my history books!..."
- "History: it's like gossip, but older."

### **"How Are You" Gets Personality**

**You ask:**
```
How are you?
```

**Ribit responds:**
```
I'm doing wonderfully! My circuits are humming, my algorithms are singing, 
and I haven't crashed in at least... *checks watch* ...3 minutes! How are you?
```

**Other examples:**
- "Fantastic! I've been contemplating the nature of existence, organizing my digital sock drawer, and waiting for your question."
- "I'm in tip-top shape! All systems operational, humor module engaged, and existential dread at a comfortable 23%."
- "Splendid! My mood is set to 'cheerfully helpful' with a dash of 'playfully witty'."

## Casual Question Handling

### **Math Operations**

**Addition:**
```
You: How much is 10 plus 10?
Bot: Ah, mathematics! The universal language! 10 + 10 = 20. 
     (No calculator was harmed in the making of this answer.)
```

**Subtraction:**
```
You: What is 20 minus 5?
Bot: 20 minus 5 is 15. Math: it's like magic, but with more numbers!
```

**Multiplication:**
```
You: What is 5 times 5?
Bot: 5 times 5 equals 25! (Multiplication: when addition gets tired.)
```

### **History Questions**

```
You: What was the war between Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands?
Bot: Let me dust off my history books! Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands 
     were involved in both World Wars. WWI started in 1914, WWII in 1939. 
     (Spoiler alert: peace eventually won.)
```

## Smart Group Filtering

### **IGNORES Group Greetings:**

```
Good morning all                 ‚ùå Ignores
Good morning everyone            ‚ùå Ignores
Hello everyone                   ‚ùå Ignores
Hi all                           ‚ùå Ignores
How are you all?                 ‚ùå Ignores
How's everyone?                  ‚ùå Ignores
How are u all doing?             ‚ùå Ignores
Good morning all hows u all      ‚ùå Ignores
```

**Why?** These are social greetings directed at the group, not questions for the bot.

### **RESPONDS to Real Questions:**

```
How much is 10 plus 10?          ‚úÖ Responds
What was the war?                ‚úÖ Responds
How's the weather?               ‚úÖ Responds
What is consciousness?           ‚úÖ Responds
```

**Why?** These are genuine questions seeking information.
