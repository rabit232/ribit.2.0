# Ribit 2.0 - Learning Features Documentation

Advanced learning capabilities for improved fluency, consistency, and natural conversation.

---

## Overview

Ribit 2.0 now includes powerful learning features that allow it to:
- **Learn from message history** by scrolling back through Matrix rooms
- **Adapt conversation style** to match individual users
- **Avoid repetition** with frequency and presence penalties
- **Speak more naturally** using learned vocabulary and phrases
- **Maintain consistency** across conversations

---

## New Components

### 1. Message History Learner

**Module:** `ribit_2_0/message_history_learner.py`

Scrolls back through Matrix room history to learn from past conversations.

**Features:**
- Analyzes user communication patterns
- Extracts topics and interests
- Learns vocabulary and common phrases
- Identifies user preferences
- Stores conversation context

**Usage:**
```python
from ribit_2_0.message_history_learner import MessageHistoryLearner

learner = MessageHistoryLearner(knowledge_base)

# Learn from room history
summary = await learner.scroll_and_learn(
    client=matrix_client,
    room_id="!room:matrix.org",
    limit=1000,  # Max messages to process
    days_back=30  # How far back to go
)

# Get user profile
profile = learner.get_user_profile("@user:matrix.org")

# Get conversation context
context = learner.get_conversation_context("!room:matrix.org")
```

**What It Learns:**
- User communication patterns (message length, emoji usage, formality)
- Topics discussed (quantum physics, AI, programming, etc.)
- Vocabulary (unique words used frequently)
- Common phrases (2-3 word combinations)
- User interests (based on content analysis)
- Conversation context (recent messages)

### 2. Enhanced Mock LLM

**Module:** `ribit_2_0/enhanced_mock_llm.py`

Extended MockRibit20LLM with advanced parameters and learning integration.

**New Parameters:**

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `temperature` | 0.0-2.0 | 0.7 | Controls randomness/creativity |
| `top_p` | 0.0-1.0 | 0.9 | Nucleus sampling threshold |
| `frequency_penalty` | 0.0-2.0 | 0.5 | Penalizes token repetition |
| `presence_penalty` | 0.0-2.0 | 0.3 | Encourages topic diversity |
| `max_context_length` | int | 2000 | Maximum context to remember |
| `learning_enabled` | bool | True | Enable history learning |
| `style_adaptation` | bool | True | Adapt to user styles |

**Usage:**
```python
from ribit_2_0.enhanced_mock_llm import EnhancedMockLLM

# Create with custom parameters
llm = EnhancedMockLLM(
    temperature=0.7,  # Balanced creativity
    frequency_penalty=0.5,  # Moderate anti-repetition
    presence_penalty=0.3,  # Some topic diversity
    learning_enabled=True,
    style_adaptation=True
)

# Generate response
response = llm.generate_response(
    prompt="What is quantum physics?",
    context=["Previous message 1", "Previous message 2"],
    user_id="@user:matrix.org",
    max_length=500
)

# Change parameters
llm.set_parameters(temperature=1.2, frequency_penalty=0.8)

# Change style
llm.set_style('casual')  # or 'formal', 'technical', 'friendly'

# Get statistics
stats = llm.get_statistics()
```

## How It Works

### 1. Message History Learning

When you use `?learn`, Ribit:

1. **Scrolls back** through room history using Matrix API
2. **Processes each message** to extract:
   - Words and phrases
   - Topics and themes
   - User patterns
   - Communication styles
3. **Stores learned data** in knowledge base
4. **Adapts future responses** using this knowledge

### 2. Style Adaptation

Ribit analyzes each user's communication style:

```python
User Pattern Analysis:
- Average message length
- Emoji usage frequency
- Question rate
- Exclamation usage
- Active hours
- Common words
```

Then adapts its responses to match:
- **Casual users** ‚Üí More emojis, shorter messages, casual language
- **Formal users** ‚Üí Longer messages, formal language, fewer emojis
- **Technical users** ‚Üí Precise terminology, detailed explanations

### 3. Anti-Repetition

**Frequency Penalty:**
- Tracks how often words are used
- Reduces likelihood of repeating words
- Makes responses more varied

**Presence Penalty:**
- Tracks which topics have been discussed
- Encourages introducing new topics
- Prevents getting stuck on one subject

### 4. Temperature Control

**Low Temperature (0.0-0.5):**
- More focused and deterministic
- Sticks to known facts
- Conservative responses

**Medium Temperature (0.5-1.0):**
- Balanced creativity and accuracy
- Natural conversation flow
- Recommended for most use

**High Temperature (1.0-2.0):**
- More creative and varied
- Explores new ideas
- May be less predictable

## Examples

### Example 1: Learning from History

**User:** `?learn`

**Ribit:** 
```
üìö Starting to learn from message history... This may take a moment.

‚úÖ Learning Complete!

Processed: 1,234 messages from 15 users
Time: 18.7s

Learned:
- 456 unique words
- 189 common phrases
- 12 topics

Top Topics:
‚Ä¢ quantum: 67
‚Ä¢ programming: 54
‚Ä¢ consciousness: 42
‚Ä¢ philosophy: 38
‚Ä¢ ai: 35

Top Words:
quantum, consciousness, algorithm, entanglement, function, neural, ...

I'll now speak more fluently using this vocabulary! ü§ñ‚ú®
```

### Example 2: Style Adaptation

**Casual User (lots of emojis, short messages):**

**User:** "hey what's quantum stuff? ü§î"

**Ribit (adapted to casual style):** "Quantum physics is wild! üåå It's about how tiny particles behave in weird ways - like being in two places at once! ‚öõÔ∏è Mind-blowing, right? ü§Ø"

**Formal User (long messages, no emojis):**

**User:** "Could you please explain the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics?"

**Ribit (adapted to formal style):** "Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. The fundamental principles include wave-particle duality, quantum superposition, and the uncertainty principle. These concepts challenge our classical intuitions about the nature of reality."

### Example 3: Vocabulary Usage

**Before learning:**
"I understand quantum physics involves particles and waves."

**After learning from room with technical discussions:**
"I understand quantum mechanics involves wave functions, superposition states, and quantum entanglement phenomena."

## Configuration

### Adjusting Parameters

You can adjust parameters programmatically:

```python
# More creative
llm.set_parameters(temperature=1.2)

# Less repetitive
llm.set_parameters(frequency_penalty=0.8)

# More topic diversity
llm.set_parameters(presence_penalty=0.6)

# Multiple at once
llm.set_parameters(
    temperature=0.9,
    frequency_penalty=0.7,
    presence_penalty=0.4
)
```

### Changing Styles

```python
llm.set_style('casual')    # Friendly, lots of emojis
llm.set_style('formal')    # Professional, precise
llm.set_style('technical') # Detailed, accurate
llm.set_style('friendly')  # Warm, engaging
llm.set_style('default')   # Balanced
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I haven't learned from message history yet"

**Solution:** Use `?learn` command in the room.

### Learning takes too long

**Solution:** Reduce the limit: `?learn 500 14`

### Responses still seem repetitive

**Solution:** 
1. Increase frequency penalty: `llm.set_parameters(frequency_penalty=0.8)`
2. Learn from more messages: `?learn 2000`

### Bot doesn't adapt to my style

**Solution:**
1. Make sure style adaptation is enabled
2. Send more messages so Ribit can learn your pattern
3. Use `?learn` to analyze your messages
