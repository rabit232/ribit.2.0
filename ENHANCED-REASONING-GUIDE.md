# üß† Enhanced Reasoning Engine Guide

## Overview

Ribit 2.0 now has an advanced reasoning engine that intelligently analyzes input, decomposes complex tasks, and provides more thoughtful, context-aware responses!

---

## üéØ What's New

### **1. Intelligent Input Analysis**
Ribit now deeply analyzes every query to understand:
- **Intent** - What you're trying to accomplish
- **Complexity** - How difficult the task is
- **Sentiment** - Your emotional state
- **Requirements** - What you need in the response
- **Entities** - Key topics, technologies, concepts
- **Question Type** - Definition, procedural, causal, etc.

### **2. Task Decomposition**
For complex queries, Ribit breaks them down into manageable steps with clear reasoning for each step.

### **3. Context Awareness**
Ribit remembers recent conversations and uses that context to provide better responses.

### **4. Response Quality Evaluation**
Ribit evaluates its own responses to ensure they're complete, relevant, and helpful.

## üìä Input Analysis Features

### **Intent Detection**
Ribit identifies what you want:
- `definition_request` - "What is X?"
- `instruction_request` - "How to do X?"
- `explanation_request` - "Why does X happen?"
- `assistance_request` - "Help me with X"
- `creation_request` - "Create/make X"
- `evaluation_request` - "Review/analyze X"
- `greeting`, `gratitude`, `farewell` - Social interactions

### **Complexity Assessment**
- **Simple** - Straightforward, single-step queries
- **Moderate** - Multi-step or technical queries
- **Complex** - Multiple components, advanced concepts

### **Sentiment Detection**
- **Frustrated** - "stuck", "confused", "not working"
- **Excited** - "awesome", "amazing", "love"
- **Curious** - "wonder", "interesting", "what if"
- **Grateful** - "thanks", "appreciate"
- **Neutral** - Default state

### **Question Classification**
- **Definition** - "What is X?"
- **Procedural** - "How to X?"
- **Causal** - "Why X?"
- **Temporal** - "When X?"
- **Locational** - "Where X?"
- **Identity** - "Who X?"
- **Quantitative** - "How much/many X?"

## üéØ How It Improves Responses

### **Before (No Reasoning):**
```
User: How to build a web app?
Ribit: You can use frameworks like Flask or Django...
```

### **After (With Reasoning):**
```
User: How to build a web app?

Ribit's Internal Analysis:
- Intent: instruction_request
- Complexity: moderate
- Needs: step_by_step, code_example
- Method: programming_assistant

Ribit: üåê How to Build a Web Application

Let me break this down into steps:

1. Choose Your Stack
   - Frontend: React, Vue, or Angular
   - Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Ruby
   - Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB

2. Set Up Development Environment
   ```bash
   # Example with Python Flask
   pip install flask
   ```

3. Create Basic Structure
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def home():
       return "Hello World!"
   ```

4. Add Database
5. Implement Authentication
6. Deploy to Production

üí° Tip: Start simple and add features incrementally!

Would you like detailed code for any specific step?

## üß© Task Decomposition

For complex tasks, Ribit creates a structured plan:

### **Example: Complex Programming Task**

```
Query: "Create a REST API with authentication and database"

Decomposition:
1. analyze_requirements
   ‚Üí Understand API endpoints needed, auth method, database schema

2. research
   ‚Üí Look up best practices for REST API design
   ‚Üí Find authentication patterns (JWT, OAuth)
   ‚Üí Research database integration

3. structure_response
   ‚Üí Organize by: Setup ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Endpoints ‚Üí Testing

4. provide_examples
   ‚Üí Show code for each component
   ‚Üí Include configuration files

5. add_context
   ‚Üí Security best practices
   ‚Üí Performance tips
   ‚Üí Common pitfalls to avoid
```

---

## üîÑ Context Awareness

Ribit remembers your recent conversation:

```
You: What is Python?
Ribit: Python is a high-level programming language...

You: How do I install it?
Ribit: (Remembers you're asking about Python)
       To install Python...

You: Show me an example
Ribit: (Remembers context: Python installation)
       Here's a simple Python example...
```

---

## ‚úÖ Response Quality Evaluation

Ribit evaluates its own responses:

```python
Evaluation Criteria:
- Is the response complete?
- Does it address the question?
- Are examples provided when requested?
- Is code included for programming questions?
- Is the tone appropriate for user sentiment?
- Are sources cited for factual claims?

Confidence Score: 0.0 - 1.0
- 0.8+ : High confidence, complete answer
- 0.5-0.8 : Moderate, may need improvement
- <0.5 : Low confidence, try alternative methods
```
