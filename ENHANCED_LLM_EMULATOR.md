## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```python
from ribit_2_0.mock_llm_wrapper import MockRibit20LLM

# Initialize the enhanced LLM emulator
llm = MockRibit20LLM("knowledge.txt")

# Get a decision for a given prompt
decision = llm.get_decision("Navigate to the target location")

# Check capabilities
capabilities = llm.get_capabilities()
```

### Robot Control Application

```python
# For robot.2.0 integration
llm = MockRibit20LLM()
robot_decision = llm.get_decision("Control the robotic arm to pick up the object")

# The emulator will provide appropriate control commands
# tailored for robotic applications
```

### Multi-Step Task Execution

```python
# Drawing task example
llm = MockRibit20LLM()

# Step 1
decision1 = llm.get_decision("Draw a house")
# Returns: run_command('mspaint.exe')

# Step 2
decision2 = llm.get_decision("Continue drawing the house")
# Returns: type_text('Creating a beautiful dwelling...')

# And so on until task completion
```
