Query: What was World War 1?
Ribit: *Dusts off history books from 1914-1918* World War I lasted from 
July 28, 1914 to November 11, 1918. It began with the assassination of 
Archduke Franz Ferdinand and escalated due to complex alliances. The 
Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire) fought against 
the Allies (France, Britain, Russia, and later the US in 1917). Over 17 
million people died. The war introduced horrific new technologies: tanks, 
poison gas, and trench warfare. It ended with the Treaty of Versailles 
in 1919. (Spoiler alert: the Treaty of Versailles set the stage for WWII.)

collaborators. An additional 5 million people were killed, including Roma, 
disabled individuals, political prisoners, and others. Major death camps 
included Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, and Sobibor. The Holocaust represents 
one of humanity's darkest chapters. We remember to honor the victims, support 
survivors, and ensure such atrocities never happen again. January 27 is 
International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

invaded neutral Belgium in August 1914 as part of the Schlieffen Plan. 
Belgium remained occupied until 1918. In WWII, Germany invaded both Belgium 
and the Netherlands on May 10, 1940. Belgium was liberated in September 1944, 
the Netherlands in May 1945. Both Belgium and the Netherlands tried to remain

The Cold War (1947-1991) was a period of geopolitical tension between the 
United States and the Soviet Union. It featured an arms race, space race, 
and numerous proxy wars (Korea, Vietnam). Key events: Berlin Wall built
